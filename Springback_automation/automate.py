# main piece of code to automate the
#function and library imports

#Workflow
#1. read the paths files



#2. create the destination folder


#3. copy and move the files to the destination folder



#4. get the variables that need to be changed and the values
#(process variables excluding geometry)



#5. Geometry variations (to be done later)



#6. Run the simulation loop
#6.1 Apply the changes to the input files (material identified in step 4)
#6.2 Generate simulation ID
#6.3 Submit the simulation
#6.4 check if the simulation has ended
#6.4.1. Read the ASCII results and
#6.4.2. Save to the dataframe
#6.4.3. Backup the results
#6. Run the simulation loop

#7. Visualize the results
